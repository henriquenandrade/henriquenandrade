# Henrique Andrade

ðŸ’» I'm a huge programming enthusiast (currently self-taught) and I like to create things using code.

I currently work in the area of â€‹â€‹technical support and customer service in the commercial systems sector.
I've been trying to improve myself in programming (PHP, JS) through the creation of personal projects.
